# Random Quote Machine
An updated version of the previous random quote machine app. Previously, an array of stored quotes and another separate array for the quotes' corresponding authors had been used. This app was updated as an opportunity to practice ['Working with APIs'](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-working-with-apis) and promises. Quotes are retrieved from a [stoic quote](https://github.com/tlcheah2/stoic-quote-lambda-public-api) api.

## Additional adjustments:
- Added a small fade-in intro
- Lowered the saturation of some colors
- Responsive to mobile screens
- Added link to github
